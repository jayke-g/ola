      "All of these posters were created for my TikTok account, where I upload videos weekly, showcasing my creative process of designing (in some cases, redesigning) posters. When I started this account, I was mainly concentrating on redesigning film posters. However, with time, I began creating posters featuring viral song lyrics, and I started gaining more followers through this. It is a great exercise for me; I not only design posters but also practice my video editing skills and connect them with marketing and promoting my videos.",

Imagine a world where the childlike essence of storytelling meets the profound themes of displacement and discovery. I've crafted each page to be a visual feast, playful yet poignant, mirroring the emotions of my own experiences.",
      "The vibrant hues and whimsical illustrations dance alongside quotes from Le Guin, creating a fusion that not only tells my story but invites you to reflect on broader societal narratives. It's not just a zine; it's a conversation starter, an exploration of the intersection between personal narratives and the collective human experience.",

      "A couple of years ago, I created a design for my film photography focused YouTube channel that I shared with my partner. It was one of the first projects I undertook when I started practising graphic design. Some time passed, and so I decided to redesign it to assess how my skills had evolved. I wanted to retain certain elements from my old design, such as colours and forms, but I aimed to give it a more contemporary feel. Additionally, I wanted to imbue the design with some meaning behind the forms."

In 2023, following an update to Stavební spořitelna České republiky's brand identity, I seamlessly transitioned the entire social media content strategy to align with the newly provided brand book. This strategic shift ensured a cohesive and professional representation of the bank's updated visual identity across various online platforms.",

      "We continued crafting themed posts about renovations. Each post had its own hashtag, such as living room, inspiration, tips, etc. There were fewer collages and more single photos spread across the Instagram carousel.",
      "We also kept the competition posts going strong. I consistently placed them on a solid colour background from the client's brand book, and sometimes we added a puzzle, just like we used to.",
      "One of my recent projects was a series of videos following the story of a family our client was assisting with renovating their house. I edited the footage into small stories, each with its own topic and included some pictures taken during the renovation. The post you see here serves as an introduction to the series, titled: 'We advise, fix, but more importantly, we help.'",
